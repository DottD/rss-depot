<li>Has a deep understanding of server/network security concepts and implementations.</li>

            <h2>About this job</h2>
<p><span>Compensation: <strong>$95k - 120k | Equity</strong></span><br/><span>Location options: <strong>Remote</strong></span><br/><span>Job type: <strong>Full-time</strong></span><br/><span>Experience level: <strong>Senior</strong></span><br/></p><br/><br/><h2>Technologies</h2> <p>reactjs, python, typescript, nosql, postgresql</p> <br/><br/><h2>Job description</h2> <p>Property&nbsp;Meld's vision is to radically improve how the property management industry handles property maintenance. If you've ever had a maintenance issue at your housing rental, you know how much of a pain it can be to get it fixed quickly and reliably. This pain is felt by everyone involved, from the resident to the coordinator to the technician doing the actual repairs. It doesn't have to be this way.</p>
<p>Our mission is threefold:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. Provide a positive experience for all participants in the property maintenance process&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. Intelligently improve efficiency</p>
<p>3. Deliver transparency and a sense of control</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a small but growing company with funding and hundreds of happy customers. Over the past five years, we&rsquo;ve homed in on the challenges our customers face when running their maintenance department, namely, running an efficient maintenance department requires cooperation, communication, and the ability to see through the fog to focus on what actually matters. The stakes are high for our customers. A bad maintenance experience is the number one reason renters move out when they otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t have. If property repairs take too long or cost too much property managers are on the hook both financially and legally. With over 30 million units for rent in the United States alone the opportunity is sizeable.</p>
<p>Your contributions will be critical to the success of our customers and Property Meld. Our core product is a multitenant web application that services hundreds of thousands of users. You&rsquo;ll occasionally wear multiple hats and will need to quickly come up to speed on various parts of the application. You can expect to be responsible for the entire lifecycle of a given project &ndash; that is, engineering design, estimation, development, deployment, and monitoring. We&rsquo;re pragmatic about engineering decisions and prioritize rapidly and consistently delivering value to our customers above all else.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have the freedom to choose how to solve problems, given the constraints of the business and infrastructure. With this freedom, you&rsquo;ll be expected to make sound decisions and to swiftly iterate on them until they are either successful or we&rsquo;ve learned a new direction would be more prudent. Many of the challenges you will encounter won&rsquo;t have any low hanging fruit left. As a result, you&rsquo;ll need to design and implement solutions that have a higher degree of difficulty than initial glance might suggest.</p>
<p>What you might work on</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Scaling, hardening, and adding to our partner integrations</li>
<li>&nbsp;Adding features to improve the workflow for maintenance coordinators</li>
<li>&nbsp;Improving the CI/CD deployment pipeline</li>
<li>&nbsp;Designing and implementing an analytics platform for our users to measure the performance of&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;their maintenance operations</li>
<li>&nbsp;Building a real-time data pipeline</li>
</ul>
<p>What might make you a good fit</p>
<ul>
<li>8+ years of professional software development experience</li>
<li>Excellent verbal and written communicator</li>
<li>A bias for action</li>
<li>Strong analytical and problem-solving capabilities</li>
<li>Ability to work with leadership on translating initiatives into product features.</li>
<li>You can anticipate the technical needs of the application and work to communicate those to their&nbsp; &nbsp;stakeholders</li>
<li>&nbsp;Have shipped high-quality production software at scale</li>
<li>&nbsp;Experience with any of the following: Python, Typescript, React, Relational databases, NoSQL&nbsp; &nbsp;databases</li>
</ul>
<p>Pay and benefits</p>
<p>Candidates MUST be eligible for full-time employment in the United States.</p>
<p>The product team at Property Meld is a remote-work organization. We require 4 hours of overlap time, daily, with the Mountain Time Zone. The position is 99% remote, with the following non-pandemic exceptions: Once a year, the total company gets together for a week of getting to know each other and to better understand the big picture of the company and how we work in each department and role. Two times per year the product team gets together in the same physical location to get to know each other better and work through interesting challenges together. In addition, once a quarter, on your schedule, you are expected to visit with a customer and shadow them learning how they are using and not using our product.</p>
<p>We value diverse points of view and know that our differences make us stronger, we believe in fostering a place to work that is open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy.&nbsp; We strongly encourage applications from individuals who are under-represented in the tech industry, across color, creed, race, ethnic and national origin, physical ability, gender, and sexual identity, or any other basis.</p>
<p>Our benefits package is designed to be a part of our employees&rsquo; story of living well. We believe in our culture of trust and respect, where we have reasonable working hours, vacation time used for rejuvenation, employee wellness &amp; health, and employee development,</p>

<p>We are a team of innovative, insightful, energetic scientists, engineers, technologists and healthcare visionaries, striving to significantly improve outcomes for cancer patients.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking for talented, proactive people who are driven to help others, fulfill the promise of precision medicine for cancer patients, and cultivate their career path along the way. If you enjoy collaborating with inspiring teammates, creating and supporting products that really make a difference, we want you.</p>
<p>We're hiring an experienced full-stack software engineer for our Informatics team.</p>
<p><strong>👩&zwj;💻 What You'll Do</strong></p>
<p>Software powers everything that we do, from the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) tracking tumor samples to the data pipelines analyzing results to the portal conveying reports back to physicians.</p>
<p>The Strata Informatics team is responsible for all these systems, overseeing Strata&rsquo;s interactions with several dozen healthcare partners.</p>
<p>This team is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development of Strata&rsquo;s ordering and results portal</li>
<li>Integration, analysis, and reporting of data received from Strata&rsquo;s partners</li>
<li>Creation and maintenance of internal tools used throughout the company</li>
<li>Integrations with electronic medical record (EMR) systems (e.g. Epic, Cerner)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>✅ You Should Have</strong></p>
<p><em>Technical Chops</em></p>
<ul>
<li>3+ years of full-stack professional development experience.</li>
<li>Core development experience in a language like Python, Ruby, Go, JavaScript.</li>
<li>Excellence in one or more of the following: React, MySQL, Postgres, OAuth, AWS, CI/CD, infrastructure as code (no one is a master of all).</li>
<li>Genomics, biotech, or healthcare domain knowledge (e.g. HL7, FHIR, EMR, NGS, FDA Approval) is nice-to-have but we don't expect batteries to come included.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>People Skills, We Have People Skills</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Empathy: You meet users where they're at; if they're frustrated, then you're frustrated.</li>
<li>Pragmatism: Technologies are important, but the problems you're solving are primary. Value isn't delivered until it's in the customers' hands. Time to ship matters.</li>
<li>The Team, The Team, The Team: You want to bring others along and join them on the journey. That means soliciting opinions (and offering yours), never hesitating to help out, and prioritizing what's right for the patient, Strata, Informatics, and yourself (in that order).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>🧬 Our DNA</strong></p>
<p>With Ann Arbor roots and employees around the country, this is a phenomenal place to make an impact and move fast. We also have fun and support employees in their learning including paid conference attendance.</p>
<p>Within engineering, we believe that small teams have asymmetric impact and that asynchronous, thoughtful responses are more effective than instantaneous reactions.</p>
<p>Agile really does mean individuals and interactions over processes and tools. Practices like scrum or XP are nice, but <em>if</em> we use them, they serve the people; people don&rsquo;t serve them.</p>
<p>Join us, challenge your career and skills, be rewarded, and make an impact on something that matters&ndash;the lives of cancer patients.</p>
<p>We welcome a brief cover letter with your resume submission. Tell us about yourself.</p>

<p><strong>This is a remote role accepting applicants only from European Union</strong>. A high degree of autonomy is offered and we expect you will use it to make decisions and shape the future of our software stack.</p>
<p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p>

<p><strong>Here are some ideas we have that might help you figure that out:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Autonomy: you will choose the tools you want to use and get to make all the technical decisions as long as they make sense (that's for the CTO to approve)</li>
<li>Mastery: we will encourage and support you to learn as long as it takes so you can feel proud about your work (the nice side effect of this is having awesome products built by you)</li>
<li>Offering the best and expecting to get the same in return: annual allowance for gear upgrades (chair, computer, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Us</strong></p>
<p>We're part of a group of companies which operate some of the biggest real-estate web portals in four countries in Asia and Africa. Our purpose is to help provide the technology for these high traffic websites as well as for the back-office operations including sales and marketing.&nbsp;</p>

This is a great chance to join the revolution transforming the entertainment industry.&nbsp;<strong>We are growing</strong>&nbsp;and are seeking experienced developers who can help us deliver our vision for a fairer, more transparent future for high-end content production. We&rsquo;re an open organisation and understand that you are a person and not just a code-production unit.</p>
<p>We want to find a collaborator who loves to be part of a team, someone is technically capable and also future-looking who can communicate clearly and collaborate effectively to make a great customer experience happen. We are looking for someone with good technical experience as we want to focus on helping you understand the world of film and television and what our clients need rather than helping you learn about technology.</p>
<p>Our software is built with Python, Javascript and Postgres and deployed on AWS.</p>

<p><strong><u>What will you be doing?</u></strong></p>
<p>You'll be working as part of a cross-functional team tackling a specific business problem which might be enhancing some of our existing functionality to help make it more useful, or creating a whole new feature set for a new audience. Whatever happens the work is going to be varied!</p>
<p>We'd want you to have a commitment to the idea of solving problems with&nbsp;<strong>working software</strong>. Leading by example and taking the initiative to break impasses and help the whole team move forward collectively.</p>
<p>We also want you to bring an engaged, informed voice to our technical discussions. As a team we are constantly trying to find the right balance of innovation and convention in our use of technology.</p>
<p>We'll also want you to find it natural to share what you know with colleagues and to want to support them. We have internal training and knowledge-sharing sessions and you'll be expected to be part of supporting and sustaining that culture as well as learning yourself.</p>
<p>While line management is not mandatory we would like you to have empathy and a desire to connect with and support other members of the team. We'd like you to be able offer support and energy to those who would benefit from it.</p>
<p>If you are interested in line management, we will support you with personalised coaching to help you manage yourself and give you a safe place to talk about how to develop and support others.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>How do we work?</u></strong></p>
<p>Typically we use an informal Lean Agile process where empowered self-organising teams are granted a lot of autonomy to pursue the business objectives they've been set. This means there can be a lot of variability in how exactly teams operate as what works for an experimental discovery project isn't the same as delivering work for a big feature film on a deadline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You'll prefer the freedom to refine your ways of working instead of following a prescribed process. We're a small team so we are always interested in techniques and solutions that maximise our impact and which help people join the team and be productive quickly. We have regular forums for discussion and hold retrospectives on projects and incidents to try and make sure we are always seeking to improve. We would like you to be proactive in seeking to fix problems and build on success.</p>
<p><strong><u>Key benefits</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Work with a brilliant and committed team of industry experts and specialists and a supportive, hands-on leadership team</li>
<li>Be a key decision maker at an early stage of new business lines but without the startup uncertainty</li>
<li><strong>People are our assets,</strong>&nbsp;not our resources</li>
<li>Transparency is a company value with company updates open to everyone</li>
<li>Competitive salary, 24 days holiday, company MacBook</li>

<p>Designed by analysts but built for the entire team (security operations, threat intelligence, incident response and security leadership), ThreatConnect&rsquo;s intelligence-driven security operations platform is the only solution available today with intelligence, automation, analytics, and workflows in a single platform. Centralize your intelligence, establish process consistency, scale operations, and measure your effectiveness in one place. To learn more about our threat intelligence platform (TIP) or security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) solutions, visit ThreatConnect.com.</p>
<p><strong>Job Description</strong></p>
<p>We are looking for a Python Developer to join the ThreatConnect Engineering Team. Cyber threats are ever present and constantly evolving, leaving major companies all over the world at risk. This is where ThreatConnect steps in. So if you&rsquo;re interested in having a real impact on the security landscape of these companies by working on an intelligent innovative product, this might be the role for you.</p>
<p>Job descriptions are by nature, extremely specific. While it may seem like we&rsquo;re looking for a very specific candidate, we encourage you to apply if:&nbsp;<em>you have an insatiable passion for learning new products, designing intelligent solutions, and love seeing your hard work come to life for our users.</em></p>
<p><strong>About You</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>You crave knowledge and experience.</strong></em>&nbsp;You&rsquo;re the kind of person who looks for opportunities to learn new technologies and gain knowledge. Once you finish one task you are ready to gain experience from the next.</p>
<p><em><strong>You are a great communicator.</strong>&nbsp;</em>You are comfortable speaking with stakeholders that have a variety of backgrounds: engineers, security analysts, and product management alike. The medium doesn&rsquo;t matter, sudo code and written functional requirements are all just a way to make sure we&rsquo;re able to find the signal in the noise the right way.</p>
<p><em><strong>You are detail-oriented.</strong></em>&nbsp;You&rsquo;re the kind of person who won&rsquo;t just close a tab and say &ldquo;that&rsquo;s probably close enough.&rdquo; You naturally try to optimize solutions to problems in your life. You prefer your requirements to read like a bulletproof set of rules to a game, rather than buzzword soup. You like thinking through the corner cases of a dataset to figure out where the landmines might be hidden before you step on them.</p>
<p><em><strong>You are a tinkerer.</strong>&nbsp;</em>As a person you love to build new skills and get excited about new subject matter. You relish the idea of applying your skills to other facets of your life outside of work. Learning is a constant for you, where any problem without an immediate solution is just an opportunity to grow and master something new.</p>
<p><em><strong>You get restless when things get &ldquo;stagnant.&rdquo;</strong></em>&nbsp;We&rsquo;re looking to do better than just writing code; we want to solve a problem. You want our products to be invaluable and help make our users more efficient. When the game changes beneath your feet, you&rsquo;re excited to start running in a new direction.</p>
<p><strong>Things You Will Do</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Write beautiful and well structured code that is reusable by our customers</li>

<p>Our flagship product is the artificial intelligence algorithm where it is the computer, not the physician, diagnosing patients. Built on a series of patented machine learning algorithms, our FDA cleared software platform detects early signs of diabetic retinopathy, a debilitating eye disease that impacts the 30+ million people with diabetes in the US. We are using everything we&rsquo;ve learned from IDx-DR to expand our artificial intelligence platform to help patients by detecting diseases like skin cancer.

<li>Has&nbsp;5+ years&nbsp;software development&nbsp;experience</li>
</ul>
<p>Then apply to be our next Senior Mobile Software Engineer!</p>

<ul>
<li>Strong technical communication skills: you should be comfortable taking an active part in design reviews and code reviews and mentoring</li>
<li>Has experience designing, implementing, and deploying complex software solutions</li>

</ul>
<p>This is a permanently remote position. We have engineers across the United States in many different time zones.

<p><strong>More about WalletHub</strong></p>
<p>WalletHub is a high-growth fintech company based in Washington, DC that is looking for talented, hard-working individuals to help us reshape personal finance. More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we&rsquo;re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;<strong>Customized Credit-Improvement Tips</strong>: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;<strong>Personalized Money-Saving Advice</strong>: WalletHub&rsquo;s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;<strong>Wallet Surveillance</strong>: Personal finance isn&rsquo;t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</p>
<p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they&rsquo;re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.</p> <br/><br/>

We&rsquo;ve got some huge goals and are looking to add new members to our all-star team to help get us there!</p>
<p>We're big on training and helping members of our team broaden their skillset to meet new challenges.</p>

You will be responsible for working with many different employees, including developers, other members of the development operations team, the VP development and the CTO.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Research, plan and develop ways to make our analytics dashboards and error monitoring more meaningful and improve their signal-to-noise ratio</li>
<li>Research, plan and develop ways to ensure that our alerts are being sent on meaningful events</li>
<li>Develop ways to reduce manual work associated with internal administrative procedures</li>
<li>Perform both planned and unplanned deployments to our staging and production environments</li>
<li>Be a member of the on-call rotation to resolve critical multiple-customer-affecting issues</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent organizational and communication skills.</li>
<li>A comfort level with working on multiple projects at once.</li>
<li>Knowledge of fundamental back-end technologies - Linux, SQL and Python - is needed</li>
<li>Familiarity with DevOps/SRE tools and concepts - Ansible, Azure and Docker/Kubernetes experience is beneficial.</li>

<ul>
<li>An introductory call with the hiring manager (VP Development)</li>
<li>A small take-home project to evaluate your programming</li>
<li>A videoconference interview with a mix of directed and open-ended technology questions</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the emphasis is placed on your performance in the take-home and interviews rather than on past experience, curriculum vitae or academics.</p>
<p><strong>Compensation</strong></p>
<p>Encircle invests a lot of effort into designing salary ranges that are competitive for the industry, the Kitchener-Waterloo area and your role. This will be discussed in the introductory call with your hiring manager. Compensation also includes an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP), a competitive health benefits package, and access to the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) counselling service.</p>

<p>Our mission is to secure the human layer. This involves deploying near real-time machine learning models at massive scale to some of the world&rsquo;s largest organisations to keep their most sensitive data private and secure. To do this, we're looking for a senior data scientist with NLP experience ready to work on hard problems, drive best practice and cultivate an environment of experimentation and learning. Companies can leverage data science in a number of ways, and we think the role of a Data Scientist falls into three distinct categories:&nbsp;</p>

<p>2) You are responsible for writing production models to enhance the main product, e.g recommendation systems for e-commerce</p>
<p><strong>3) You are&nbsp;the product - without machine learning, it wouldn't exist&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Curiosity and Grit</strong>:&nbsp; The ideal candidate will be someone who is curious and loves to tinker/build solutions.&nbsp; The thing we admire most about a great analyst is that they have an uncanny ability to be obsessed about a problem they are trying to solve and come hell or high water, they will find a solution for it.&nbsp; The person we hire for this role will need that same kind of characteristic so that we can give them a problem and they can not only meet the requirements but exceed them in spectacular fashion.&nbsp; We want someone who is able to obsess over problems until they find the best solution and who cares deeply about making the customer&rsquo;s mission successful.</p>
<p><strong>Functional Capabilities:</strong> The core functions of this position include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing a deep understanding of the customer&rsquo;s mission, CONOPS, capabilities/limitations, IT ecosystem, security apparatus, policies/processes, and culture.&nbsp; This insight will enable the candidate to help customers navigate complex people-centered technology challenges and deliver first-class capabilities to solve mission needs.</li>

<p><strong>A day at Neybox</strong></p>
<p>All team members start their day with a five-minute report of what they will be working on. The rest of the day is spent doing great work.</p>
<p>We also have 1-2 meetings per week to plan upcoming tasks or review our progress. It's that simple!</p>
<p><strong>What we offer</strong></p>
<p>We offer a great salary, paid vacation time, and financial support for opportunities that will help you grow as a professional. We reward every team member with additional bonuses and benefits for great work and personal or team goals achieved.</p>
<p>If that sounds like what you're looking for, apply for the position, and we'll reach out to set up a meeting to get to know you better.</p> <br/><br/>

Our teams work autonomously to deploy these systems across a common infrastructure, up to 3,000 times a day. As we&rsquo;ve grown to serve over 75,000 customers in 100 countries, reliability and stability have become just as important as speed and time to market.

<li>Evangelize best practices around reliability engineering</li>
<li>Proactively identify risks and advocate for engineering process, tooling, or work streams that reduce that risk in a customer centric way</li>
