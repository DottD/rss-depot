The RSS feeds that you find in `rss-gen` are automatically generated from the Python scripts in the `master` branch.

## Complete list of feeds

## How to customize your script

If you like the RSS Feed structure generated by the scripts in the `master` branch, but you want to customize the search options and other parameters, do as follows:

* create your own branch
* remove everything inside it but the `.gitignore`
* move the `main.yml` to a folder named `.github/workflows`
* write a configuration file with your own customizations to the feed content; you can start from the configuration files in my branch `dottD`
* update the links above to point to your files; it suffices to edit the branch part accordingly, i.e. replace `dottD` to `<your-branch-name>`
